I'm part of the team at [Skip](https://www.skipwithjoy.com/), building a powered exoskeleton to make movement joyful for the 1 billion people with reduced mobility. Before joining Skip, I have worked on designing and controlling exoskeletons while at Google X, Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, and the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab.
